# Unique ID Device List
# -------------------------------
# This is a simple UID and device name key-value pair, that is automatically generated at startup
#  to help humans distinguish which UID belongs to which device in this config file.
#  Only the device name is given here, complete Device information can be requested from the API.
#  UIDs are generated sha256 hashes based on specific criteria to help determine device uniqueness.
# ANY CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.
# Example:
# 21091c4fb341ceab6236e8c9e905ccc263a4ac08134b036ed415925ba4c1645d = "Nvidia GPU"

# Legacy690 Option for devices
# -------------------------------
# There are 2 Asetek 690LC liquid coolers that have the same device ID.
#  To tell them apart we need user input to know which cooler we're actually dealing with.
#  This is an assignment of liquidctl AseTek690LC device UIDs to true/false:
#   true = Legacy690 Cooler aka NZXT Kraken X40, X60, X31, X41, X51 and X61
#   false = Modern690 Cooler aka EVGA CLC 120 (CLC12), 240, 280 and 360
# Example:
# 21091c4fb341ceab6236e8c9e905ccc263a4ac08134b036ed415925ba4c1645d = true

# Device Settings
# -------------------------------
# This is where CoolerControl will save device settings for the cooresponding device.
# Settings can be set here also specifically by hand. (restart required for applying)
# These settings are applied on startup and each is overwritten once a new setting
# has been applied.
# Example:
# [device-settings.4b9cd1bc5fb2921253e6b7dd5b1b011086ea529d915a86b3560c236084452807]
